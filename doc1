# Best Practices for Server Security

Maintaining a secure server is essential to protect your players, resources, and data from potential threats. Follow these best practices to secure your FiveM server.

## Step 1: Implement Whitelisting

1. Use a whitelisting system to control who can access your server:
   - Many scripts available in **The A Team** store support whitelisting functionality.
   - Alternatively, configure a database-driven whitelist using SQL.

2. Regularly update the whitelist to include or remove players as necessary.

## Step 2: Secure Server Configuration Files

1. **Restrict access** to critical configuration files like `server.cfg`:
   - Ensure only trusted administrators have access.
   - Store sensitive data (e.g., database credentials) in an environment file (`.env`) instead of directly in `server.cfg`.

2. Use encryption for sensitive information.

## Step 3: Configure Anti-Crash and DDoS Protection

1. Add these critical security settings to your `server.cfg` to protect against various attack vectors:
   ```plaintext
   # Layer 7 DDoS Protection and Anti-Crash Settings
   set sv_requestParanoia 3        # Blocks L7 DDoS attacks by limiting HTTP requests
   set sv_endpointprivacy true     # Enhances endpoint security
   set sv_forceIndirectListing true # Forces indirect server listing
   set sv_useDirectListing true    # Works with indirect listing for enhanced protection
   
   # Authentication Protection
   set sv_authMinTrust 4           # Higher trust requirement for identity verification
   set sv_authMaxVariance 5        # Controls identity change probability
   ```

2. These settings provide multiple layers of protection:
   - **L7 DDoS Protection**: `sv_requestParanoia` blocks HTTP-based attacks by limiting access to server endpoints
   - **Anti-Crash Measures**: The combination of endpoint privacy and listing settings helps prevent common crash attempts
   - **Authentication Security**: Stricter identity verification prevents spoofing attacks

3. Detailed Parameter Information:
   - **sv_requestParanoia**:
     - Helps counter proxy-based HTTP floods
     - Values 2 and above will return "Nope" for info.json, dynamic.json and players.json endpoints
     - Default: 0
     - More info: [FiveM Documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/server-commands/#sv_requestparanoia-newvalue)

   - **sv_authMinTrust**:
     - Defines how unlikely it is for a user's identity to be spoofed
     - Range: 1-5 (1 being least trustworthy, 5 being most trustworthy)
     - Level 5 indicates external three-way authentication
     - Default: 1

   - **sv_authMaxVariance**:
     - Determines likelihood of user ID changes for providers (steam, ip, license)
     - Range: 1-5 (1 being least likely to change, 5 being most likely)
     - Default: 5

4. Important Notes:
   - With `sv_requestParanoia 3`, the `/players.json` endpoint will return "Nope" after first access:
     
     ![Protected Server Response](/static/screenshots/server-protection/protected-server.png)
     
     Subsequent attempts will be blocked for several minutes:
     
     ![Second Attempt Blocked](/static/screenshots/server-protection/second-try.png)

   - For comparison, an unprotected server response looks like this:
     
     ![Normal Server Response](/static/screenshots/server-protection/normal-server.png)

   - If using Cloudflare or other proxies, be aware these settings may affect proxy functionality:
     
     ![Proxy Configuration](/static/screenshots/server-protection/proxy.png)

   - You may notice this warning in your txAdmin console which you can safely ignore:
     
     ![txAdmin Warning](/static/screenshots/server-protection/txadmin.png)
     
     This is part of FiveM's security improvements. For more details, see the [official announcement](https://forum.cfx.re/t/celebrating-one-year-with-rockstar-games/5269938#fivem-and-redm-6).

   - Regular monitoring of server logs is essential to ensure these protections work effectively

## Step 4: Enable Resource Integrity

1. Add resource integrity checks to prevent unauthorized modifications:
   - Define proper file dependencies in resources `fxmanifest.lua`.
   - Regularly verify that no files have been altered without your knowledge.

2. Monitor resources with the FiveM `resmon` tool:
   ```plaintext
   resmon 1
   ```

## Step 5: Monitor Server Logs

1. Regularly review server logs to detect suspicious activity:
   - Look for unusual player actions or failed connection attempts.
   - Track errors and warnings that might indicate vulnerabilities.

2. Use tools like [txAdmin](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin) to monitor logs efficiently.

## Step 6: Update Resources and Server Software

1. Keep FiveM server artifacts updated to the latest version:
   - Download updates from the official FiveM site.
   - Restart your server to apply updates.

2. Update purchased scripts and resources from **The A Team** store to their latest versions.

## Step 7: Limit Admin Access

1. Assign admin roles sparingly to trusted individuals only.
2. Use role-based permissions to restrict access to sensitive commands or features.

## Step 8: Protect Against DDoS Attacks

1. Use a hosting provider that offers DDoS protection.
2. Monitor network traffic for unusual spikes.

## Step 9: Backup Regularly

1. Schedule regular backups of your server files and database.
2. Store backups in a secure, off-site location to ensure recovery in case of data loss.
